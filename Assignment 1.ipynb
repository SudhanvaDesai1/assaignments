    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* -is a expression\n",
    "'hello' – is a value\n",
    "-87.8 – is a value\n",
    "- -is a expression\n",
    "/  -is a expression\n",
    "+\t-is a expression \n",
    "6 –is a value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans: String is a data type whereas, a variable is a place where the datatypes are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Int –This datatype is used to store the values in the integer format.\n",
    "Eg. 5,7,2,etc.\n",
    "Float  –This datatype is used to store the values in the decimal format including a decimal point.\n",
    "Eg. 5.22, 3.12,etc.\n",
    "Str –This datatype is used to store the sequence of the alphanumeric characters enclosed within  the single quotes(‘’) or double quotes(“”)\n",
    "Eg. “Sudhanva”, ‘@animals’,’1234’.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans: The Expression is made up of the mathematical operators which perform some specific mathematical operations or perform a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans: The Expression is something that evalues to a  value. While  the Statement is used to do something with the given line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: bacon contains 22 as there is no assigning of the bacon+1 value to  something\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: According to the rules of naming the variable the variable name should always start with the Alphabet or has to start with a under score(  _  ), Hence the 100 as a variable name is a invalid one. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: str() –To get a string version of value\n",
    "         Int() –To get a integer verion of value\n",
    "         Float() –To get a floating version of value\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The python compiler can’t concatenate the string with the integer type of data. So, in order to solve the issue we have to either put quote the numbers or use string function as \n",
    "Sol 1.  'I have eaten ' +’ 99 ‘+ ' burritos.'\n",
    "Sol 2. 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n",
